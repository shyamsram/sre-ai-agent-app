# SRE AI Agent App

This is a starter Python project for building an Agentic AI application using MCPs.

## Structure
- `agent.py`: Main entry point for the agent workflow.
- `mcp_client.py`: Stub MCP client for interacting with MCP servers.

## Getting Started
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies (add as needed):
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Run the agent:
   ```bash
   python agent.py
   ```

## Next Steps
- Implement MCP server interaction in `mcp_client.py`.
- Integrate with your application logic and UI.
